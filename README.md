As per reports, coal is the largest source of electricity generation in India and fuels approximately 74% of India's electricity.  India is the world's second-largest coal producer after China and is dependent on coal for many of its core sectors.   I have made a dashboard on Coal mining in India, an in-depth analysis covering various aspects of coal mining in India.
